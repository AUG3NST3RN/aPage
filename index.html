        <h2>Why I Choose Game Design</h2>
        <p>Game design is my major for Bachelor of Art degree in NYU. I started to know about Game Design at the beginning of high school. The intriguing game engines and mechanics in board games and card games caught my attention immediately. As I dived deeper into this field, I began to study audio design and technical management.</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction to Game Design</h2>
        <p>Game design is both an art and a science focused on creating engaging experiences through structured play. It covers elements like rules, narratives, goals, and mechanics, all crafted to captivate players, provide unique challenges, or tell compelling stories. Game designers combine psychology, storytelling, mathematics, and art to create experiences that entertain and sometimes explore deeper themes or reflect cultural trends.</p>
        
        <h2>Board Games and Early History</h2>
        <p>The history of game design extends back thousands of years, with traditional board games like <strong>Senet</strong> in ancient Egypt (3500 BCE) and <strong>Go</strong> in China (over 2,500 years old) serving as tools for social interaction and strategy. In the 20th century, games like <strong>Monopoly</strong> (1935) and <strong>Risk</strong> (1957) introduced complex strategies to broader audiences. <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong> (1974), a tabletop role-playing game, marked a significant milestone, introducing storytelling and world-building elements that laid the groundwork for modern video game narratives.</p>
        
        <h2>Rise of Video Games</h2>
        <p>The arrival of digital technology in the 1970s gave birth to video games, which started with titles like <strong>Pong</strong> (1972) and <strong>Space Invaders</strong> (1978). These early games paved the way for an industry that would evolve rapidly, incorporating more sophisticated graphics, gameplay mechanics, and narrative depth over time.</p>
